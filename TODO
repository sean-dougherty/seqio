- thread-safe fasta reader
  - seek/read of stream must be in mutex
  - read/tellEnd of sequence must be in mutex

x determine type from file

- port cli tools to use c api

   - pna

- sequence seek

- use uint64_t for read

*** TEST ***
- partial read of fasta sequence, followed by iteration.
- thread safety of fasta reader
- get_key, get_value, set_err_handler (return)
